Test Observations:

1. When submitting from csfr_form.php with the correct CSRF token, the login succeeds if the credentials are correct.
2. When submitting from csfr.html, the login fails with "CSRF validation failed" since the token is missing.
3. This proves the CSRF protection works by checking if the token matches the one stored in the session.

Conclusion:
Using session-based CSRF tokens mitigates unauthorized form submissions from external pages.
